            <h1 style="font-size:50px">What is Breast Cancer?</h1>
            <h4>Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds
                of breast
                cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.<br>

                Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. A breast is made up of three main parts:
                lobules,
                ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules are the glands that produce milk. The ducts are tubes that
                carry milk
                to the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds
                everything
                together. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts or lobules.

                Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When breast cancer
                spreads
                to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized</h4>

        <div class="image-a"><img src="image10.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="350"></div>

        <p><a>Some factors that increase your risk of breast cancer include:</a>

        <ul>

            <li>increasing age</li>

            <li>history</li>

            <li>inheritance of mutations in the genes BRCA2, BRCA1 (more common with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage) and

            <li>exposure to female hormones (natural and administered)</li>

            <li>starting your period before the age of 12</li>

            <li>a previous breast cancer diagnosis</li>

            <li>a past history of certain non-cancerous breast conditions.</li>
        </ul>


        Lifestyle factors that can also slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in men and women include:
        <ul>

            <li>being overweight</li>
            <li>not enough physical activity</li>
            <li>drinking alcohol.</li>
            There is also an association with some benign breast disease and past exposure to radiation.

        <h1>Types of Breast Cancer</h1>
        <div class="image"><img src="image8.svg" alt="" width="700" height="500"></div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Invasive Breast Cancer</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Invasive breast cancer means that the cancer cells have grown through the lining of the ducts into the
                surrounding breast tissue. NST stands for No Special Type.<br>

                Most invasive breast cancers have no special features and are classed as No Special Type. NST is
                sometimes
                called NOS (not otherwise specified). It was previously known as invasive ductal carcinoma. Around 70
                out of
                100 (around 70%) invasive breast cancers are this type.<br>

                Special type means that when the doctor looks at the cancer cells under a microscope the cells have
                particular features. Breast cancers that are classed as special type include some rare types of breast
                cancer.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Invasive lobular breast cancer</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Invasive lobular breast cancer means that the cancer started in the cells that line the lobules and has
                spread into the surrounding breast tissue. The lobules are the glands that make milk when
                breastfeeding.Invasive lobular breast cancer is the second most common type of breast cancer. Around 15
                in
                every 100 breast cancers (around 15%) are invasive lobular carcinoma. This type can develop in women of
                any
                age. But it is most common in women between 45 and 55 years old.

                Breast cancer is very rare in men. It is also very unusual for a man to have an invasive lobular type of
                breast cancer.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Triple negative breast cancer</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Triple negative breast cancers are cancers whose cells don't have receptors for:

            <ul>
                <li>the hormones oestrogen and progesterone</li>
                <li>Her2 protein</li>

            </ul>
            Your doctor uses a sample of your cancer to test the cells for these receptors. You might have this testing
            following a biopsy of the cancer, or after surgery to remove it.

            A rare type of breast cancer known as basal type breast cancer is usually triple negative. Some women with
            triple negative breast cancer also have a BRCA1 gene fault. BRCA1 is one of the gene faults that can
            increase the risk of breast cancer within families.

            Some men have triple negative breast cancer but this is very rare. Most men have oestrogen receptors in
            their cancer cells.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Inflammatory breast cancer</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                This is a rare type of breast cancer. The cancer cells block the smallest lymph channels in the breast.
                The
                lymph channels (or lymph ducts) are part of the lymphatic system. They normally drain excess tissue
                fluid
                away from the body tissues and organs.

                The lymph channels can't do this job properly if they are blocked. This blockage causes the skin to
                become
                red and inflamed.

                Between 1 and 5 out of 100 breast cancers (1 to 5%) are inflammatory breast cancers.

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Angiosarcoma of the breast</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Breast angiosarcomas are cancers that start in the cells that make up the walls of blood vessels or
                lymphatic
                vessels. They are very rare and make up less than 1 in 100 breast cancers (less than 1 %).

                It is mostly seen in women, but men can also get this type of breast cancer.

                They are divided into:
            <ul>
                <li>primary angiosarcoma</li>
                <li>secondary angiosarcoma</li>
            </ul>



            Primary angiosarcoma of the breast starts in the breast tissue and may involve the skin of the breast. They
            tend
            to develop in younger women in their 30s or 40s.

            Most secondary angiosarcomas of the breast occur due to having radiotherapy to the breast for a previous
            breast
            cancer. These cancers usually develop in older women.

            Angiosarcomas tend to grow quickly and are generally difficult to treat.

            <li>
                <h3>Breast cancer in men</h3>
            </li>
            <div class="imageb"><img src="image12.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="400"></div>
            <p> Breast cancer is rare
                in men. There are about 350 men diagnosed each year in the UK. This compares to
                around
                55,000 cases in women.

                About 1 in 100 (about 1%) of breast cancer cases in the UK are in males.

                There are some similarities between male breast cancer and female breast cancer. But there are also
                important differences between the two. The most common type in both women and men is called 'invasive
                ductal
                carcinoma - no special type'.

                Some men develop rarer types of breast cancer, such as inflammatory breast cancer. Or they might develop
                conditions related to breast cancer but these are very uncommon. They include:
            <ul>
                <li>ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</li>
                <li>invasive lobular cancer</li>
                <li>Paget's disease of the breast</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                DCIS means that some cells in the lining of the ducts of the breast tissue have started to turn into
                cancer
                cells. These cells are all contained inside the ducts. They have not started to spread into the
                surrounding
                breast tissue.
                Doctors might describe DCIS in different ways. These include pre invasive, non invasive, ductal
                intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN) or intra ductal cancer.

                In some people if DCIS is not treated, it could become an invasive cancer. DCIS and invasive breast
                cancer
                are not the same thing.

                In invasive breast cancer, the cancer cells have broken out of the ducts and spread into the surrounding
                breast tissue. There is then a chance that the cells can spread into nearby lymph nodes or other parts
                of
                the body.
            </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) means that cells inside some of the breast lobules have started to
                become
                abnormal. LCIS It is not a cancer.

                The lobules are glands that make breast milk. The abnormal cells are all contained within the inner
                lining
                of the lobules. LCIS is also called lobular neoplasia. It might be found in both breasts.

                LCIS is not a cancer, but having it means that you have a small increased risk of getting invasive
                breast
                cancer in either breast in the future. Even so, most women with LCIS won't develop breast cancer. Men
                can
                develop LCIS but this is very rare.
            </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Paget's disease of the breast</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                This condition develops in the nipple or the darker area of skin around it (the areola).

                Paget's disease is a sign that there might be breast cancer in the tissues behind the nipple. It is
                possible
                for someone to have Paget's of the breast with no underlying cancer but this is less common.

                About half of the people diagnosed with Paget's disease have a lump behind the nipple. In 9 out of 10
                cases,
                this is an invasive breast cancer. Invasive breast cancer can also be present in some people with
                Paget's
                disease who have no lump.

            <div class="imagec"><img src="image14.png" alt="" width="800" height="400"></div>



            <p>
                Staging helps describe how much cancer is in your body. It's determined by several factors, including
                the
                size
                and location of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread to other areas of your body. The basic
                breast
                cancer
                stages are:
            <ul>
                <li>Stage 0. The disease is non-invasive. This means it hasn't broken out of your breast ducts.</li>
                <li> Stage I. The cancer cells have spread to the nearby breast tissue.</li>
                <li>Stage II. The tumor is either smaller than 2 centimeters across and has spread to underarm lymph
                    nodes
                    or larger
                    than 5 centimeters across but hasn't spread to underarm lymph nodes. Tumors at this stage can
                    measure
                    anywhere
                    between 2 to 5 centimeters across, and may or may not affect the nearby lymph nodes.
                </li>
                <li> Stage III. At this stage, the cancer has spread beyond the point of origin. It may have invaded
                    nearby
                    tissue
                    and lymph nodes, but it hasn't spread to distant organs. Stage III is usually referred to as locally
                    advanced
                    breast cancer.

                </li>
                <li>Stage IV. The cancer has spread to areas away from your breast, such as your bones, liver, lungs or
                    brain. Stage
                    IV breast cancer is also called metastatic breast cancer.
