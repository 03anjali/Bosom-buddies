    <h2><p> Here are some alarming facts about breast cancer in India that will help patients understand breast cancer and the reason to opt for a personalized treatment:</h1></p>
    
    <div class="para"> 

      
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
    <p>• Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in India.</p>

    <p>• Breast cancer is the most common cancer in most cities and the second most common in rural India.</p>
      
    <p>• Breast cancer accounts for 25% to 32% of female cancers in all cities across India.</p>
      
    <p> • In India, one woman is diagnosed with breast cancer every 4 minutes.</p>
      
    <p> • One woman dies of breast cancer, every 13 minutes in India.</p>
      
    <p>• An estimated 70,218 women died of breast cancer in India, in the year 2012, the highest in the world for that year.</p>
      
    <p>• Only 60% of women who are treated for breast cancer, survive for at least five years post-treatment in India as compared to 89% in the US.</p>
      
    <p> • The high mortality rate is due to the lack of awareness and delay in screening and diagnosis.</p>
      
    <p> • More than 50% of breast cancer patients in India are suffering from stage 3 and 4, where the chances of survival are extremely low.</p>
      
    <p> • India sees a spurt in the cases of breast cancer in the age group of 30 to 50, and the same is likely to increase.</p>
      
    <p>• Breastfeeding often interrupts periods, which leads to fewer menstrual cycles and less estrogen exposure, leading to about a 4.3 percent reduction in the overall risk of breast cancer for every 12 months of breastfeeding.
      <p> <h3>According to the National Institute of Health, breast cancer survivors are at an increased risk of osteoporosis. Estrogen has a protective effect on bones, and reduced estrogen levels can trigger bone loss. <i class="fa fa-hand-o-down"></i></h3></p>

        <p> <h2>Breast cancer cannot be prevented but it can surely be treated within time. Here are some things that all of us can do. </h2></p>
        <p> • Be aware and spread about breast cancer diagnosis, symptoms, breast cancer recurrence tests, and the right treatment.</p>
      
        <p> • Learn about self-tests and regularly examine your breasts on your own.</p>
      
        <p> • Visit an oncologist if you feel any abnormalities in your breasts.</p>
      
        <p> • Early detection is a blessing. It means breast cancer can be treated, and you have the chance to live a healthy life post-recovery.</p>
      
        <p> • Stage 1 and 2 breast cancer patients are eligible to take breast cancer recurrence prediction test namely CanAssist Breast to find out their recurrence risk score.</p>
      
       <p> • Depending on the score, the doctor and patient can personalize their treatment.</p></div>

        <h4>63% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed at a localized stage (there is no sign that the cancer has spread outside of the breast), for which the 5-year survival rate is 99%.</h4>

        <h3>Genes</h3>
      <p>Every cell in your body contains genes. Genes contain the blueprints (genetic code) for your body.
        
        For example, genes contain the information that determines the color of your eyes. They also contain information that affects how the cells in your body grow, divide and die.
        
        The information in your genes is passed on (inherited) from your mother and your father. And, you can pass this information on to your children (your daughters and your sons).</p>
        <h3>Inherited gene</h3> 
        Inherited mutations
        Some changes in the genetic code that affect the function of the gene are called mutations. Mutations are rare.
        Just as with other information in genes, mutations can be passed on from a parent to a child.
        
        You get half of your genes from your mother and half from your father. So, for example, if your mother has a BRCA1 gene mutation, there’s a 50 percent chance you will also have a BRCA1 mutation.Inherited gene mutations may also be called germline mutations.
        <p>Inherited gene mutations known to increase the risk of breast cancer are rare in the general population.

        In the U.S., 5-10 percent of breast cancers are related to an inherited gene mutation [4,28].
        
        BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BReast CAncer genes 1 and 2) are the most well-known genes linked to breast cancer risk.
        
        Everyone has these genes. But some people have an inherited mutation in one or both genes that increases the risk of breast cancer.</p>

         <h1>Genetics</h1>
      </div> 
        
    <p>Statistics indicate  that 5% to 10% are genetics related specifically distortion in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Needful to say that both men and women have these genes equally so it can be passed from either the father or the mother. It’s worth mentioning that infected close relatives like (mother, sister, uncle, cousin, grandpa, etc) increase the chances of getting breast cancer by double.</p>
    <p>For some people, though, the chances of having a BRCA gene mutation are much higher. Genes are inherited, which is why knowing your family history is important when determining breast cancer risks. If one of your parents has a BRCA mutation, you have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene.</p>
    <div class="img3">
      <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.63EinwhHx_uB2rHFgyPR8wHaD4?w=336&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="Genatics" usemap="#workmap" width="450" height="300">
    </div>
    <p>Because the overall odds are so low, most experts recommend that only people with a heightened risk get tested for BRCA mutations. Likewise, insurance companies often only cover genetic counseling and testing for individuals who are at high risk. A person could be considered at high risk for BRCA mutations if they have a family history of:

      Breast cancer diagnosed before age 50.
      Male breast cancer at any age.
      Multiple relatives on the same side of the family with breast cancer, particularly if they are first-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter).
      Multiple breast cancers in the same woman, meaning breast cancer developing in both breasts over time or at the same time.
      Both breast and ovarian cancer in the same woman.
      A history of ovarian cancer in the woman’s family, especially if a first-degree relative.</p>
     <p>Genetic risk factors for breast cancer: clinical applications
      Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are rare but underlie severe and early-onset forms of the disease. Screening for mutations in women with a strong family history, usually linked to BRCA mutations, determines individual risks for this early-onset form of disease. However, most patients (~95%) do not show clear-cut family histories of early- or later-onset disease. The role of more common breast cancer variation in risk prediction is far less well established. Pharoah et al45 determined a multiplicative model using the 12 most significant common variants to define individual relative risks in the range 0.4-fold to fourfold compared with the general population.
       Given that there is a 12% population lifetime risk, deleterious common mutations contribute a 24%–36% lifetime risk, which may be high enough to instigate earlier and more intensive screening for common genetic forms of the disease. Gulcher and Stefansson46 point out that some women classified as at average risk would be reclassified as at higher risk based on their profile of common breast cancer variation.
       Similarly, some women might be reclassified as having lower-than-average risk based on their common gene profile. Risk estimates might be more reliably determined by multiplying risks from the genetic profiles with independent risks from conventional measures, such as family history, age at menarche, and pregnancy history. Successful application of common breast cancer gene profiles in clinical practice would have potential benefits by facilitating earlier diagnosis, reduced costs, less intensive therapeutic intervention, and disease management in the longer term.</p>
