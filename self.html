    <h1>Breast Self-Exam</h1>
    <div class="para1">
        <p>Cancer develops in the tissues of breasts, affecting both men and women due to different reasons like
        family
        history or changes in genes and progress through stages. Symptoms would be the presence of a lump in the
        breast
        and change in the appearance of the breast. Treatment is primarily based on the type and stage of
        cancer.</p></div>

        <p>When breast cancer is detected early, and is in the localized stage, the 5-year relative survival rate is
            99%.
            Early
            detection includes doing monthly breast self-exams, and scheduling regular clinical breast exams and
            mammograms.Adult women of all ages are encouraged to perform breast self-exams at least once a month.
        </p>
        <p>“Forty percent of diagnosed breast cancers are detected by women who feel a lump, so establishing a
            regular
            breast self-exam is very important.”</p>


        <p>Once A Month
            “Forty percent of diagnosed breast cancers are detected by women who feel a lump, so establishing a
            regular
            breast
            self-exam is very important.”
            While mammograms can help you to detect cancer before you can feel a lump, breast self-exams help you to
            be
            familiar
            with how your breasts look and feel so you can alert your healthcare professional if there are any
            changes.

        <h2>How Should A Breast Self-Exam Be Performed?</h2>

        <p>
            1) In the Shower With the pads/flats of your 3 middle fingers, check the entire breast and armpit area
            pressing down with
            light,
            medium, and firm pressure. Check both breasts each month feeling for any lump, thickening, hardened
            knot, or
            any
            other breast changes.

            With the pads/flats of your 3 middle fingers, check the entire breast and armpit area pressing down with
            light,
            medium, and firm pressure. Check both breasts each month feeling for any lump, thickening, hardened
            knot, or
            any
            other breast changes.

            Visually inspect your breasts with your arms at your sides. Next, raise your arms high overhead.
            Look for any changes in the contour, any swelling, or dimpling of the skin, or changes in the nipples.
            Next,
            rest
            your palms on your hips and press firmly to flex your chest muscles. Left and right breasts will not
            exactly
            match—few women’s breasts do, so look for any dimpling, puckering, or changes, particularly on one side.
        </p>


        <p>

            2) Lying Down

            When lying down, the breast tissue spreads out evenly along the chest wall. Place a pillow under your
            right
            shoulder
            and your right arm behind your head. Using your left hand, move the pads of your fingers around your
            right
            breast
            gently covering the entire breast area and armpit.

            Use light, medium, and firm pressure. Squeeze the nipple; check for discharge and lumps. Repeat these
            steps
            for
            your
            left breast.
        </p>

            Breast cancer can’t usually be prevented, but you can take three important steps to help detect it
            earlier.
            The
            free resource, 3 Steps to Early Detection, can increase your chance of finding breast cancer before it
            spreads.

        <h3>
            Step 1. Observe your breasts
        </h3>
        <p>Start by looking in the mirror at your breasts with your shoulders straight and your arms on your hips.

            Here are some things to look for:
        <ul>
            <li> Breasts of the same size, shape, and colour as before</li>
            <li>Evenly formed breasts with no obvious deformation or swelling</li>
        </ul>





        </p>
        <h3>Step 2. Raise your arms and look for changes</h3>
        <p>
            Raise your arms now and look for the same changes as mentioned above.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Step 3. Look out for any leaking fluid
        </h3>
        <p>
            Look in the mirror for any evidence of fluid leaking out of one or both nipples while you're there (this
            could
            be a
            watery, milky, or yellow fluid or blood).
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4. Feel your breasts while laying down</h3>
        <p>
            Then, while lying down, feel your breasts with your right hand on your left breast and your left hand on
            your
            right
            breast. Keep your fingers flat and together while applying a firm, smooth touch to the first few finger
            pads
            of
            your
            hand. Make a quarter-sized circular motion with your hands.
            Feel all of the tissue in your breasts, from the front to the back: light pressure for the skin and
            tissue
            just
            beneath; medium pressure for the tissue in the middle of your breasts; hard pressure for the deep tissue
            in
            the
            rear. You should be able to feel down to your ribs once you've reached the deep tissue.

        </p>
        <h3>Step 5. Feel your breasts while standing</h3>
        <p>Finally, while standing or sitting, feel your breasts. Many women like to conduct this step in the shower
            since
            it is
            easier to feel their breasts when their skin is moist and slippery. Using the same hand movements as in
            step
            4,
            cover your entire breast.


            Note-In case your breasts have a lumpy or odd shape. It is critical to get medical advice as soon as
            possible.
